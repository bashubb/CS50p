CS50p Problem set 4: Emojize
=======

Description
-----------

Emojize is a Python program created as a solution to CS50p Problem Set 4. This program enables users to input an English string and receive an "emojized" version as output. The transformation involves converting emoji codes or aliases within the text, and the implementation utilizes the `emoji` library.

How It Works
------------

1.  **User Input**: The program prompts the user to provide an English string.

2.  **Emojization Process**: Using the `emoji` library, the program converts any emoji codes or aliases present in the input string to their corresponding emoji representations.

3.  **Output Display**: The emojized version of the input string is displayed as the output.

Example
-------

Suppose the user inputs `:thumbs_up:`. The program outputs:

```bash

Input: :thumbs_up: Output: üëç
```
