CS50p Problem set 0: Playback Speed
==============

This is my solution to the CS50p Problem Set 0, "Playback Speed." The goal was to create a Python program, `playback.py`, that transforms text input in a creative way.

Approach 🎥
-----------

The program takes user input and modifies it by introducing a distinctive playback speed effect. Rather than echoing the input directly, it replaces spaces between words with three periods (ellipsis). This results in an output that visually simulates slowed-down speech, akin to the playback speed feature found on platforms like YouTube.

Notable Features 🚀
-------------------

-   **User Interaction:** The program prompts users to input their text.
-   **Creative Output:** Replacing spaces with ellipses provides a unique and visually interesting representation of slowed-down speech.
-   **Simplicity:** The solution is concise, using basic string manipulation functions in Python.

Example 🌟
----------

```bash

$ python playback.py
Type your message:
This is CS50 Output: This...is...CS50
```

Source Code Highlights 📝
-------------------------

```python

message = input("Type your message: ")
print("Output:", message.replace(" ", "..."))
```

This solution is part of my submission for CS50p Problem Set 0, showcasing a playful and creative approach to text transformation. 🌈
