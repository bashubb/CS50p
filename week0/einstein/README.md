CS50p Problem set 0: Einstein 
===========================================================

This Python program, `einstein.py`, is my solution to the CS50p (CS50 Problems) Problem Set 0 challenge, which focuses on implementing a program that demonstrates mass-energy equivalence using Albert Einstein's famous formula E=mc^2.

How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
----------------

1.  **Speed of Light Constant**: The program sets the speed of light as a constant (approximately 300,000,000 meters per second).

2.  **User Input**: It prompts the user to input mass (in kilograms), assuming the user provides a valid integer.

3.  **Energy Calculation**: The program calculates the equivalent energy using the formula E = mc^2, where E represents energy, m represents mass, and c represents the speed of light.

4.  **Output**: The calculated energy value is then printed to the console, showcasing the energy-mass equivalence.

Example Usage üöÄ
----------------

Suppose the user inputs a mass of 14 kilograms:

```bash
Enter mass (in kilograms): 14 
Output: 1260000000000000000
```

In this example, the program demonstrates that a mass of 14 kilograms is equivalent to 1,260,000,000,000,000,000 Joules of energy.
