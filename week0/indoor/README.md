CS50p Problem set 0:  Indoor Voice
============

This is a solution for the CS50p Problem Set 0, titled "Indoor Voice." The objective is to create a Python program, `indoor.py`, that prompts the user for input and outputs the same input in lowercase, preserving punctuation and whitespace.

How It Works
------------

The provided Python script takes user input and converts it to lowercase, maintaining the original punctuation and whitespace. No need for explicit instructions; just run the program and experience the transformation from uppercase to lowercase.

Example
-------

```bash
$ python indoor.py 
Type your message: Hello, CS50! 
Output: hello, cs50!
```
