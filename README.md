CS50p 2023
==========

CS50 with Python is Harvard University's introductory course focusing on programming fundamentals using the Python programming language. It's designed for both majors and non-majors, regardless of prior coding experience. You can access the course materials and learn more about it [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/).

I created this repository to save all my solutions for the problems proposed on the course. Every exercise scored 100% on submission!
